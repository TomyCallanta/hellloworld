## What is Git?
Git is a Version Control System.
> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or 
set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions 

later.
> - Scott Chacon and Ben Straub

## What is GitHub?
> GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects. 
You donâ€™t have to worry about losing data on your hard drive or 
managing a project across multiple computers â€” sync from 
anywhere. Most importantly, GitHub is a collaborative and 
asynchronous workflow for building software better, together.
