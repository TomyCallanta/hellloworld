##How is Git/GitHub relevant to me at all?
Git/GitHub can make working with a team on a project safe and hassle-free.
By keeping track of previous software versions, it can make finding causes 
of errors in the code or adding a feature to the project without risking 
the rest of the code a lot easier.
